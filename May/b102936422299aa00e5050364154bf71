Durban - About 100 bikers dressed in tuxedos, suits and bow ties rode through the streets of Durban on Sunday to raise funds and awareness for men’s health issues. The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride campaign sees dapperly dressed bikers riding to raise funds and awareness for issues like prostate cancer as well as break the stigma and silence surrounding mental health. It was founded a decade ago by Mark Hawwa from Sydney, Australia who was inspired by a photograph of Don Draper from the television show Mad Men. Draper was astride a classic bike and wearing his finest suit. John Aritho, general manager of the Beverly Hills hotel, organised this year’s ride in Durban. Aritho said the cause was important as it was the societal norm for men to suffer in silence. “My dad died of cancer and we did not know until it was too late. He just did not tell us about his cancer,” he said. The ride brings like-minded individuals across the globe together to ride classic and vintage style motorcycles from cafe’ racers and side cars to choppers and classic scooters. Durban motorbike enthusiast, Mark Bray, said it took him a year to build his cafe’ racer from scratch. “It is great to connect with people who have the same interests as you, we have a WhatsApp group where we chat, but sometimes when you go out on the road and you see someone with their bike you just get talking and become friends. The ride is just like that, but on a much larger scale,” he said. Honorary Consul of Georgia, Triveshan Naidoo, said the ride was both a unique and worthy cause. “Unfortunately, some fund-raisers or campaigns can be boring or mundane, but the ride combines our passions with the opportunity to do some good at the same time, which is great. It is not something that happens everyday. Last year was tough on everyone, so being able to ride for a good cause and bring some joy into the world is fantastic.” Sunday Tribune
